## Introduction

In this repository, you will find Java implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is designed to illustrate concepts such as data organization, algorithmic efficiency, and problem-solving techniques.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- **ArrayList**: array data structure.
- **String**: String data structure.
- **Searching**: Linear Search and Binary Search.
- **Sorting**: All Sorting Algorithm.
- **Stack**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Linked List**: Singly linked list and doubly linked list.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of a binary search tree.
- **Collection**: collection in java.

Each data structure includes methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other operations specific to that structure.

## Algorithms

Various algorithms are implemented for tasks such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick sort, merge sort, insertion sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search.
- **BFS and DFS**: Breadth-first search and Depth-first search.
